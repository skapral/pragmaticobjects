/**
 * A hint, telling equivalence instrumentor whether the class should (or should not) be subtype of EObject.
 * If the class is abstract, and if it is extended directly from {@link java.lang.Object}, its base class is replaced to
 * {@link EObject}, and instrumentor handles its non-abstract subtypes as EObjects.
 * 
 * The abstract EObject class must fit these requirements:
 * <ul>
 * <li>All its non-abstract methods should be final</li>
 * <li>All its non-static properties should be protected final</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Instrumentation
 * post-checks will fail the instrumentation process, if any violation found.
 * 
 * For non-abstract classes, the annotation is ignored, unless "enabled" property is set to false. In this case, the class will
 * be left uninstrumented.
